## Name

Gitaly is a tribute to git and the town of [Aly][aly-wiki]. Where the town of
Aly has zero inhabitants most of the year we would like to reduce the number of
disk operations to zero for most actions. It doesn't hurt that it sounds like
Italy, the capital of which is [the destination of all roads][rome]. All git actions in
GitLab end up in Gitaly.
